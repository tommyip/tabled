User guide
==========

*If you haven't installed tableD already, please follow the instruction*
:doc:`here <installation>`.

tableD has a very simple interface. This guide covers almost everything there
is to produce pretty printed tables with tableD.

Creating a new table
--------------------

First, import the tabled package::

    import tabled

The *TableD* object is the main interface for visualizing your data, you can
create a new instance using the ``new`` function::

    >>> tabled.new(['Heading 1', 'Heading 2'],
    ...            [[1, 2], [3, 4]]).show()
    +-----------+-----------+
    | Heading 1 | Heading 2 |
    +-----------+-----------+
    | 1         | 2         |
    | 3         | 4         |
    +-----------+-----------+

Lets break this down. The ``new`` function creates and returns a TableD object,
which accepts 4 optional arguments.

Headings
""""""""

The ``heading`` argument should be a list of elements, which could be in any
Python type. Examples::

    ['Heading 1', 'Heading 2', some_variable, 10, True]

    [x for x in range(10)]  # [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

Data
""""

The second argument, ``data``, is a nested list of lists containing cell data
for the table body. Same as the headings, each cell element could be in any
Python types. Examples::

    [[1, 2], [3, 4], ["Cell 5", 6], [True, False]]

    [[x, x+1] for x in range(3)]  # [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3]]

Style
"""""

The style of the table is configured through the ``style`` argument, which is
*default* for default. There are only two styles available for now, but you
are welcome to help create more, see
:doc:`Contributors Guide<contributors_guide>` for more information.

.. code-block:: python

    headings = ['x', 'y1', 'y2']
    data = [[x, x*x, x**3] for x in range(3)]

Default::

    >>> tabled.new(headings, data).show()
    +---+----+----+
    | x | y1 | y2 |
    +---+----+----+
    | 0 | 0  | 0  |
    | 1 | 1  | 1  |
    | 2 | 4  | 8  |
    +---+----+----+

Terminal::

    >>> tabled.new(headings, data, style='terminal').show()
    ╔═══╦════╦════╗
    ║ x ║ y1 ║ y2 ║
    ╠═══╬════╬════╣
    ║ 0 ║ 0  ║ 0  ║
    ║ 1 ║ 1  ║ 1  ║
    ║ 2 ║ 4  ║ 8  ║
    ╚═══╩════╩════╝

Align
"""""

By default, the style template already provides an alignment setting, but it is
possible to customize it using this argument. The available alignments are
**left**, **center** and **right**::

    >>> tabled.new(['Heading 1', 'Heading 2'], [[1, 2], [3, 4]],
    ...            align='right').show()
    +-----------+-----------+
    | Heading 1 | Heading 2 |
    +-----------+-----------+
    |         1 |         2 |
    |         3 |         4 |
    +-----------+-----------+

Device
""""""

The ``device`` argument controls where the output is shown. The default is
``stdout``, which is your terminal or python shell.

*More device options are coming soon...*

Displaying the table
--------------------

The ``.show()`` method displays your table to standard output by default. It
supports caching, so it would rerender your data only if they were modified.

Modification after initialization
---------------------------------

The arguments to ``tabled.new()`` are optional as mentioned above, they could
be added or changed after the initialization of a new tabled instance. Although
you can modify the fields directly like any other Python objects, using the
setter methods are recommended since they validate and convert your data to
strings.

To set the headings of your table, use the ``.set_headings()`` method::

    >>> t = tabled.new()

    >>> t.set_headings(['Language', 'Typing', 'Runtime', 'Type'])

Adding a new row is similar, you can use the ``.add_row()`` method, which
accepts a list of items::

    >>> t.add_row(['Python', 'Dynamic', 'CPython', 'OOP'])

There is also a ``.add_rows()`` method that allows multiple rows to be added,
in the form of a nested list::

    >>> t.add_rows([
        ['Java', 'Static', 'JVM', 'OOP'],
        ['Elixir', 'Dynamic', 'BEAM', 'Functional']
    ])

.. note:: The number of columns of your table is determined by the headings.
          If any of your rows is shorter than the headings, blank cells would
          be appended to the end of the row.

If you now display the table, you will get::

    >>> t.show()
    +----------+---------+---------+------------+
    | Language | Typing  | Runtime | Type       |
    +----------+---------+---------+------------+
    | Python   | Dynamic | CPython | OOP        |
    | Java     | Static  | JVM     | OOP        |
    | Elixir   | Dynamic | BEAM    | Functional |
    +----------+---------+---------+------------+
