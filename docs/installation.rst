Installation
============

You can only install the package from source code right now, but it will be
available on PyPI as soon as the project reaches v1.0.0!

From source code
----------------

First clone the repository from Github::

    $ git clone https://github.com/tommyip/tabled

Then you can install it into your site-packages easily::

    $ cd tabled
    $ python setup.py install

That's it! Now try to create your first pretty printed table.
